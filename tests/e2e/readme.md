# Here will go the testing of functionalities for e2e (end to end)

Each of the routes should have an e2e test, so the goal here is to be incrementally adding test along side the features that the api demands

One drawback is that the test cannot be run all at the same time due to they all share the global mongo connection, this is to be refactored in the future
